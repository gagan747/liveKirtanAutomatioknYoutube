generate the following like syntax for .env to work this project ,include following keys for .env

client_id1
client_secret1
redirect_uri1
client_id2
client_secret2
redirect_uri2
client_id3
client_secret3
redirect_uri3

like i have generated three new projects named livekirtandarbarsahib,livekirtandarbarsahib1,livekirtandarbarsahib2 and all three have differend client secrets whose format for keys are listed above. Because to increase quota limit as each prject's quota is not sufficient for me to upload 15 videos daily and i used this trick.

simply create three projects on google console and download client_secret.json and extract above keys.For redirect_uri3 paste it's [0] value from the array in the key and it must be equal to http://localhost:5000/google/callback which you acheive by setting redirect callback uri to the http://localhost:5000/google/callback in google console

you also have to add below keys in environment:-

token_for_project1
token_for_project2
token_for_project3

and each token_for_project key is generated by starting uploadToYoutube.js single file by using node uploadToYoutube in terminal and also temporary adding and calling uploadToYoutube('./demoPathForDemoVideo') at the bottom of the file.

Depending upon values(1 or 2 or 3) of the current variable of file trackCurrentProjectCredentials.json(it is for version1 , for versions above 4, i have replaced trackCurrentProjectCredentials with redisClient having values current and perprojectquota), the token_for_project is generated accordingly.

For eg:- to generate token_for_project3, first you have to remove the token_for_project3 if already set in .env bcoz if not removed from .env,we can't create or update token value ,so you have to verify first that token_for_proj3 key is not present in .env file.Then you have to set the variable current of trackCurrentProjectCredentials.json( for version 4 and above, set these keys in redis client) file to 3(number depends upon fro which project number you are setting the token like here 3).Now run node updateToYoutube.js file and it ask to open the link in terminal.open that link and sign in with that gmail for which your youtube channel is associated and it gives you a token in browser screen which you have to paste it to terminal then.(Note:- please clear your google account cookies before sign in as when not cleared, token is still given on browser screen but when you paste that token to terminal,then your access token is generated to TOKEN path but not refresh token which creates a problem of token daily expiry,so to avoid that problem , you have to remove google cookies before sign in and then sign in and paste the token to termnal which you get from browser screen to the terminal and then refresh token is also get stored along with the access token to the TOKEN path)
(Note:- I have added prompt=consent query param in code while generating access token process,so from now onwards, it is not important to delete cookies to regenrate refresh token)

TOKEN path = home directory /.credentials/youtube-nodejs-quickstart.json

now go to TOKEN path and do CTRL + A to select whole token object including access and refresh token and paste it to as a value for token_for_project3 key.Repeat the same steps to generate the token_for_project1/2.Note:-if already generated and any of the toekn expires ,then to regenerate it ,repeat the same process as mentioned but first of all you have to delete that token_for_project's key so that the regeneration process can start and when regenrated ,copy the whole object from TOKEN path and rewrite that specific token_for_poject's key with with value as your copied text

So, you have to generate all the three token_for_projects in .env file to make this project work correctly as if any one of them is expired or missing, some videos are not uploaded as bcoz of insufficient quota,i.e,all three of them must have proper tokens such that the project does not go out of quota.
